In this difficult challenge, your goal is to answer 50 questions correctly in 3 seconds about Mandatory Access Control (MAC).
The questions will randomly change every time.
It is very unlikely that you will be able to do this by hand (in fact, we would be very surprised if you did!.
The goal of this challenge is to write a program that can interact with this program to supply the correct answers.
The goal of this challenge is to write a program that can interact with this program to supply the correct answers.
The best hacker solution is to learn to use the Python pwntools library: https://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/
Another approach would be to use the 'expect' family of libraries in your favorite programming language: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expect#Alternatives

Consider a MAC system with the following levels (from high to low):
Top Secret (TS)
Secret (S)
Confidential (C)
Unclassified (UC)

Also with the following categories:
Nuclear (NUC)
NATO (NATO)

Get them all right, and get the flag

1. Can a Subject with level TS and categories {ACE} write an Object with level TS and categories {NATO}?
